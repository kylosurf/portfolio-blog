# Part 1: Create A Simple Express Web Server
## Goal: A running Express Web Server that serves static html files

1. Start a Brand new project in a new directory
2. Use npm init to get started
3. Install Express
4. Create a file called server.js and make a basic Express server using Node
5. Configure your Express server to server static files from a directory called “public”
6. Create some basic HTML web pages as “templates/mock ups” for the different pages your Blog/Portfolio site will contain (e.g. index.html, about.html, blog.html, etc). Note that your home page will be “index.html”
7. Put these HTML files in your public directory. All HTML/CSS/Javascript/Image files can be served from the public directory.
8. Run your server using “node server.js”
9. Test your server by going to localhost:8080/
