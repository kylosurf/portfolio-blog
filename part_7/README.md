# Part 7: Blog Image Uploads
## Goal: Configure express to receive file uploads so that we can upload header images for the blog posts

1. Install the npm library [express-fileupload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-fileupload)
2. Using the documentation to help, change the Header Image input on your “Create Blog Post” form to upload a file to the server. Use $.post() to use javascript to upload the file and display a checkmark when the file is uploaded successfully to the server
3. Your Blog Post Header Image should use the image file that was uploaded to the server
