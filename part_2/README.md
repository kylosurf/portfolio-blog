# Part 2: Create Header/Footer and link Pages together
## Goal: A Website skeleton with links to the basic pages of the site

1. Create a Nav bar for the header of your page. Nav bar should have a title for your website and links to the different web pages for your site (home, blog, about, contact).
2. Each page should have the same Nav bar (for now, copy and paste the nav bar for mock-up purposes).
3. Create a footer that each page will have. The footer should say “Site created by: YOUR NAME” and have anything else that you would like. Every page must have a footer.
