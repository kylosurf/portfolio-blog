# Part 3: Bootstrap and Content
## Goal: Simple styling and placeholder content, in a mobile-first responsive layout

1. Install Bootstrap on each of your pages
2. For each of your pages add some content/images to get the layout and design of your site started. You can use “Lorem Ipsum” as placeholder text, and stock images that you find.
3. Create a styles.css file where you will put all of your global styles for your site. The file should be located in public/css/styles.css
    * You should link to styles.css from the header part of your html pages
4. Make sure you use Bootstrap rows and columns to ensure that your site is setup to be responsive. 
    * Make sure that any images and text are also responsive. 
    * Try using a “mobile first” philosophy to ensure your site looks good in a mobile size. 
    * As your site expands to a desktop size, use media queries to adjust the look at the appropriate dimensions.
5. For your home page, some ideas for sections you might include:
    * A header image with some heading text
    * A summary section where you describe your services or what your blog/site is about
    * A section about your skills/technology stack that you use
    * A section with testimonials
6. For your Blog Page:
    * A list of blog posts
    * Each item has a thumbnail image, a title, a description, and a link to “Read More”
7. For your About Page:
    * A picture of you
    * A brief Bio
8. Contact Page:
    * A form that has input for a Name, Email Address, Subject and Message
9. Any styling you want to do, put into styles.css
